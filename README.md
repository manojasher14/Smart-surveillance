This project is to design an advanced system that integrates weapon
detection, behaviour analysis, body language assessment, and facial
expression recognition can not only identify general threats but also
help in early identification of unsafe situations specifically for women.
Real-time alerts and proactive measures could be triggered when the
system detects signs of aggression or threatening behaviours toward
women, providing an essential layer of protection in vulnerable
scenarios
